<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

gdg or Granular Data Gatherer was developed in Go to fill the missing gap in the availability of an easy and open all-in-one tool to collect OS metrics for troubleshooting.  OSWatcher and nmon cannot be the only viable options.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* a server, instance, VM running a systemd-enabled Linux distribution

### Installation

Download the binary from Releases (<https://github.com/rfparedes/gdg/releases/latest/download/gdg>) to `/usr/local/sbin` on the server and run:

```sh
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/gdg
```

Start it

```sh
sudo /usr/local/sbin/gdg -start
```

Check Status Anytime

```sh
/usr/local/sbin/gdg -status
```

## Technical Details

* There are three components to gdg, each which can be separately started or stopped
   1. granular data collection using standard utilities
   2. rtmon collection of network state information
   3. process d-state detect and automated sysrq-t

* gdg uses standard Linux utilities to perform its work, including:

  * iostat
  * top
  * mpstat
  * vmstat
  * ss
  * nstat
  * ps
  * nfsiostat
  * ethtool
  * ip
  * pidstat
  * rtmon

* gdg will detect which utilities are available and only use those installed.  In advance, you can install any of the utilities above anytime before or after setup. Most of these utilities are located in only five different packages. On most distributions, sysstat package contains (`iostat`, `mpstat`, `pidstat`), nfs-common or nfs-client package contains (`nfsiostat`), procps package contains (`top`, `vmstat`, `ps`), iproute2 package contains (`ss`, `nstat`, `ip`, `rtmon`) and ethtool contains (`ethtool`).

* gdg will create a configuration file in `/etc/gdg.cfg` and a data directory in `/var/log/gdg-data`.

* gdg uses a systemd timer so there is no running daemon.

* gdg installs a systemd service and systemd timer on `-start`.

* gdg removes the systemd service and systemd timer on `-stop`.  All other files are untouched.

* gdg collects data in the `/var/log/gdg-data` directory.  The children below this directory are named after the utility (e.g. `iostat`) which collected the data.  Below this directory are .dat (e.g. `meminfo_21.03.07.2300.dat`) files named after the following format (`utility_YY.MM.DD.HH00.dat`). The .dat files contain at maximum, one hour worth of data.

* To easily search down chronologically through the data collected in the .dat file, use the search string `zzz`.

* rtmon logging needs to be enabled explicitly and will collect network state information directly from the kernel on an ongoing basis.  Enabling this enables a systemd service which is running while rtmon is enabled. This can be used to prove that service issues started after an external network failure. [[1]](#reference)

* If d-state is enabled, during each interval run, the number of processes in D state are detected and if this number is greater than or equal to a user-defined value (number of processes in D state), echo t > /proc/sysrq-trigger is executed to get a task trace of all processes.  This is a one-time action, meaning, once task trace is triggered, it won't be triggered again until user enables again explictly.
  
## Usage

### To start collection in 30s intervals, run

```sh
sudo /usr/local/sbin/gdg -t 30 -start
```

### To stop collection, run

```sh
sudo /usr/local/sbin/gdg -stop
```

### To see the data collected

```sh
cd /var/log/gdg-data
```

### To see the current status of gdg including start/stop status, version, interval, data location, and current size of collected data, run

```sh
/usr/local/sbin/gdg -status
```

e.g.

```
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  gdg status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
VERSION: gdg-0.9.0
STATUS: started
RTMON: started
INTERVAL: 30s
DATA LOCATION: /var/log/gdg-data/
CONFIG LOCATION: /etc/gdg.cfg
CURRENT DATA SIZE: 33MB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DSTATE: stopped
NUMPROCS: 0
```

### If you want to change the interval (-t) or after installing additional supported utilities, run

```sh
sudo /usr/local/sbin/gdg -reload -t 60
```

### To toggle rtmon logging on or off, run

```sh
sudo /usr/local/sbin/gdg -rtmon
```

### To enable d-state functionality to trigger sysrq-t

```sh
sudo /usr/local/sbin/gdg -d <NUMPROCS>
```

### For help

```sh
/usr/local/sbin/gdg -h
```

## Build it yourself

* You'll need a go compiler installed

Clone it

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rfparedes/gdg.git
```

Build it

```sh
cd gdg
go build -o gdg
```

Move it

```sh
mv gdg /usr/local/sbin
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/gdg
```

Start it

```sh
sudo /usr/local/sbin/gdg -start
```

## Validated Distributions

gdg has been validated on:

* SLE-12 (SLES or SLES-SAP 12 all SPs)
* SLE-15 (SLES or SLES-SAP 15 all SPs)
* openSUSE Leap 12/15
* Debian 9
* Debian 10
* RHEL7
* RHEL8
