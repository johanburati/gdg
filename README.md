<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

gdg or Granular Data Gatherer was developed in Go to fill the missing gap in the availability of an easy and open all-in-one tool to collect OS metrics for troubleshooting.  OSWatcher and nmon cannot be the only viable options.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* a server, instance, VM running a systemd-enabled Linux distribution

### Installation

Download the binary from Releases
<https://github.com/rfparedes/gdg/releases/download/v0.9.0/gdg>

Start it

```sh
sudo ./gdg -start
```

## Technical Details

* gdg uses standard Linux utilities to perform its work, including:

  * iostat
  * top
  * mpstat
  * vmstat
  * ss
  * nstat
  * ps
  * nfsiostat
  * ethtool
  * ip
  * pidstat

* gdg will detect which utilities are available and only use those.  In advance, you can install any of the utilities above anytime before or after setup.

* gdg will create a configuration file and data directory in the same directory where the gdg binary resides. e.g. If you download the binary to `/usr/local/` this directory is where metric data and config file will be stored.

* gdg uses a systemd timer so there is no running daemon

* gdg only installs a systemd service and systemd timer on `-start` outside of the working directory where the gdg binary resides

* gdg removes the systemd service and systemd timer on `-stop`.  The working directory is untouched.

## Usage

### To start collection in 30s intervals, run:

```sh
sudo ./gdg -t 30 -start
```

### To stop collection, run:

```sh
sudo ./gdg -stop
```

### To see the data collected:

```sh
cd gdg-data
```

### To see the current status of gdg including start/stop status, version, interval, data location, and current size of collected data, run:

```sh
sudo ./gdg -status
```

e.g.

```
VERSION: gdg-0.9.0
STATUS: started
INTERVAL: 30s
DATA LOCATION: /usr/local/gdg/gdg-data/
CURRENT DATA SIZE: 79MB
```

### For help

```sh
./gdg -h
```

## Build it yourself

* You'll need a go compiler installed

Clone it

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rfparedes/gdg.git
```

Build it

```sh
cd gdg
go build -o gdg
```

Start it

```sh
sudo ./gdg -start
```
